# 18.330: Introduction to Numerical Analysis

## Spring 2021

Welcome to course 18.330 at MIT! This is an introductory course on **numerical analysis**.

## Installation of required software 
We will be using the following **free / open source** software:
- The [Julia language](https://www.julialang.org)
- The [Pluto notebook](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) environment

Please follow [these  instructions](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/installation/) to install Julia and then Pluto.

## Logistics

- Visiting professor David P. Sanders ([sandersd@mit.edu](mailto:sandersd@mit.edu))

- TA: Nicholas Liu

- Tues, Thurs 1&ndash;2:30pm Eastern, virtual

- Office hours: Tues, 5&ndash;7pm Eastern

- [Piazza forum](https://piazza.com/class/kl8f7m3q7q355)


## Course materials
- **Lectures** are synchronous Zoom sessions for MIT students

- Notes are public:

  - [Lecture slides](lectures) 

  - [Pluto notebooks](notebooks)

  - [Summaries of each lecture](summaries.md)

### Evaluation

- 10 problem sets (50%). No late submissions, but the lowest score will be dropped.
- 1 midterm take-home exam (20%)
- Final project (30%)

Problem sets will consist of a mixture of theory and coding in Julia. They will be submitted and graded online.

For the final project you will explore a topic in numerical analysis that we have not covered in class (but at the level of the class). The final project must include a discussion of the mathematics behind the method, together with your own implementation in Julia.

### Learning Julia

- Prof. Steven Johnson will give an introduction to Julia on Friday, Feb 19 from 5-7pm. Make sure to install Julia beforehand. See https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit for information and resources on Julia.

- More learning resources are available at https://julialang.org/learning/

### Windows users

If you use Windows, please download Git for Windows [here](https://gitforwindows.org)

### Getting the files

To get the files, use `git` from the command line (or from a GUI), as follows

- Clone the repository once with
```
git clone https://github.com/mitmath/18330
```
This will create a new directory called `18330` with the matierials.


- Update it to pull in new changes each time with
```
git pull
```
This needs to be executed from within the directory. (Use `cd` to change directory.)
